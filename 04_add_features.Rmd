# Adding Features
## Adding features (1)
- Add a `NEWS.md` file in markdown format document track changes in the package

```{r, eval = FALSE}
usethis::use_news_md()
```

```{r comment='', echo = FALSE}
cat(readLines("files/NEWS.md"), sep = "\n")
```

## Adding features (2)

- Add a `README.(r)md` in (R)markdown format
- already filled with a nice template that can be easily adjusted
- The `README.md` generates the content at the bottom of a GitHub repository, such as how to install or use the package. 
- You can also put your badges for number of downloads, version on CRAN (if applicable), continuous integration status, and code coverage.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# plain markdown
usethis::use_readme_md()

# rmarkdown style (you can use code-chunks)
usethis::use_readme_rmd()
```
- if using Rmarkdown, one has to regularily regenerate the `md` file!
