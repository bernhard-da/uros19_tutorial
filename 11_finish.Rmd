# Even more

## Improve the package (1)
- Add `badges` to your `README.md`
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# travis
![Build](https://travis-ci.org/{user/repo}.svg?branch=master)]
(https://travis-ci.org/{user/repo})

# codecov.io
[![Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/{user/repo}/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)]
(https://codecov.io/gh/{user/repo}/branch/master)
```
- many other badges available
- don't forget the badge with the cool sunglasses from the [awesome official statistics software](https://github.com/SNStatComp/awesome-official-statistics-software)

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='10%'}
knitr::include_graphics("files/img/badge.png")
```


## Improve the package (2)
- [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) is a nice way to build a static webpage for a package
    - github has github pages (free hosting for static project pages)
    - `usethis::use_pkgdown()`
    - automatic deployment via travis $\rightarrow$ [documentation](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/reference/deploy_site_github.html)
- `devtools::spell_check()` allows to detect typos
- use package analytics, e.g. using the [cranlogs](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/) package
- think of good examples to help users

## Finishing (1)
- commit all changes to the local git repo
- push the changes to github and let the magic happen
    - the package is now built
    - checked
    - tested
    - vignettes are built
- if successful:
    - code coverage is computed and synced
    - code style is checked

## Finishing (2)
- Once everything works, it is easy to reproduce for other packages
- `devtools::release()` ? :)
