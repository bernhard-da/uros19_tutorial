# Motivation
## Warm Up
- Why
- How? $\rightarrow$ This is what we are now doing
- But: in a nice and easy way
    - using CI
    - producing nicely formatted code
    - automated tested code 
- Good ideas:
    - find a good, short name (Package [`available`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=available))
    - think about 
        * why the package exist and
        * what functionality should it contain?
    - define a namespace
